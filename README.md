### About The Project
6DegreesOfMovies is a project I made in my spare time. The main purpose of the project was to teach myself web development, as this is something I dont dont learn at university. 

6DegreesOfMovies is a game based on the idea of ​​"Six degrees of separation" which is the idea that all people in the world have no more than six social connections from each other. This idea can also be used about actors and movies. That there are no more than six films that separate two actors. I was first introduced to the topic in the subject "algorithms and computer structures" where we were given a voluntary assignment to make graphs of a data set of actors and films from IMDB. Since I'm interested in movies and thought graph theory was interesting, I thought I might turn it into a fun project.




## How to play
You are given two actors, one you start with, and one you have to navigate through movies and actors to find. You will then get a score based on how many moves you used, time and difficulty. More information at the game website.

You need to sign up for playing. You do not have to authenticate or confirm your email. The email is only used as an id to your account.

Be aware that the website is not developed for mobile useres and the GUI for mobile is therefor not great.


## Technologies

* React JS
* React-Bootstrap
* Firebase
* Python for datamanagement in dataset
* Beautiful soup for webscraping pictures

## Yet to come
The project still has a number of shortcomings that will be implemented soon. First and foremost, the website should be hosted with the domain, so that one can actually look at the project. Furthermore, the possibility to add scores and look at the scoreboard will be implemented.
